## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

#read CSVs, import
day1 <- read.csv("08.28.csv", header = T)
day2 <- read.csv("08.31.csv", header = T)
day3 <- read.csv("09.03.csv", header = T)
day4 <- read.csv("09.07.csv", header = T)
day5 <- read.csv("09.10.csv", header = T)
day6 <- read.csv("9.14.csv", header = T)
day7 <- read.csv("09.17.csv", header = T)

#snag the ZIP codes, total test numbers
aggregate <- data.frame(day1$MODIFIED_ZCTA)
aggregate$day1 <- day1$TOTAL_COVID_TESTS
aggregate$day2 <- day2$TOTAL_COVID_TESTS
aggregate$day3 <- day3$TOTAL_COVID_TESTS
aggregate$day4 <- day4$TOTAL_COVID_TESTS
aggregate$day5 <- day5$TOTAL_COVID_TESTS
aggregate$day6 <- day6$TOTAL_COVID_TESTS
aggregate$day7 <- day7$TOTAL_COVID_TESTS

#start comparing
aggregate$rate1 <- (aggregate$day2 / aggregate$day1)
aggregate$rate2 <- (aggregate$day3 / aggregate$day2)
aggregate$rate3 <- (aggregate$day4 / aggregate$day3)
aggregate$rate4 <- (aggregate$day5 / aggregate$day4)
aggregate$rate5 <- (aggregate$day6 / aggregate$day5)
aggregate$rate6 <- (aggregate$day7 / aggregate$day6)

#take the mean
aggregate$Average <- rowMeans(aggregate[,(9:14)]) - 1

#add place names
aggregate$Location <- day1$NEIGHBORHOOD_NAME

write.csv(aggregate, "datatouse.csv", row.names = T)
