## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#importing CSVs to analyze
placelist <- read.csv("geocoded-places.csv", header = T)
coordinates <- read.csv("coordinates.csv", header = T)
day1 <- read.csv("covid-testing-28oct.csv", header = T)
day2 <- read.csv("covid-testing-31oct.csv", header = T)
day3 <- read.csv("covid-testing-02nov.csv", header = T)
day4 <- read.csv("covid-testing-04nov.csv", header = T)
day5 <- read.csv("covid-testing-06nov.csv", header = T)
day6 <- read.csv("covid-testing-08nov.csv", header = T)

#start aggregating data on testing rates
rates <- data.frame(placelist[,1])
rates <- cbind(rates, coordinates)

#take the differences of those testing rates

rates$diff3 <- (rates[,8] - rates[,7])
rates$diff4 <- (rates[,9] - rates[,8])
rates$diff5 <- (rates[,10] - rates[,9])

#find the testing rate for each date
rates$diff1 <- (rates$diff1 / rates$Population)
rates$diff2 <- (rates$diff2 / rates$Population)
rates$diff3 <- (rates$diff3 / rates$Population)
rates$diff4 <- (rates$diff4 / rates$Population)
rates$diff5 <- (rates$diff5 / rates$Population)

#find the average change in testing rate
rates$change1 <- (rates$diff2 / rates$diff1)
rates$change2 <- (rates$diff3 / rates$diff2)
rates$change3 <- (rates$diff4 / rates$diff3)
rates$change4 <- (rates$diff5 / rates$diff4)

#average those changes out
rates$average <- rowMeans(rates[,(17:20)] - 1)

write.csv(rates, "avgtestingrates.csv", row.names = TRUE)
